# Fronted Starter Template

### Description:

The project is a TypeScript-based frontend template for React projects, built on
top of Vite. It incorporates essential features such as interceptors, routing
using React Router v6, schema validation with Zod, and utilizes Tailwind CSS for
styling with Shadcn for additional enhancements. This template aims to provide a
robust starting point for React developers, streamlining the setup process and
offering a foundation for scalable and maintainable web applications.

### Why it was created:

The project was created to simplify the process of setting up a modern React
project with TypeScript, providing a structured and feature-rich template that
adheres to best practices. By including commonly used libraries and tools like
React Router, Zod, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn, the template aims to accelerate
development and ensure consistency across projects. Additionally, it's designed
to be easily extensible, with plans to integrate Redux Toolkit for global state
management and custom hooks for seamless API integration in the future. Overall,
the goal is to empower developers to kickstart their projects efficiently while
fostering collaboration and community contributions through its open-source
nature.

## Features

1. TypeScript Support: Utilizes TypeScript for static typing, enhancing code
   quality and developer productivity.

2. React Integration: Designed specifically for React projects, leveraging its
   component-based architecture for building user interfaces.

3. Vite Build Tool: Built on top of Vite for fast, modern web development,
   enabling quick startup and rapid hot module replacement (HMR).

4. React Router v6: Incorporates React Router v6 for declarative routing,
   enabling navigation and rendering of different components based on URL
   changes.

5. Zod Schema Validation: Implements Zod for schema validation, ensuring data
   integrity and preventing runtime errors by validating data against defined
   schemas.

6. Tailwind CSS: Integrates Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling, facilitating
   rapid UI development with pre-defined utility classes and responsive design.

7. Shadcn Enhancements: Utilizes Shadcn for additional enhancements, such as
   utility functions or UI components, to augment the functionality of Tailwind
   CSS.
